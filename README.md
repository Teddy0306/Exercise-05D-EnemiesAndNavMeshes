# Project 5


## Implementation
Building off of the exercises, I created three unique enemies. The ghost, which moves around randomly, the ball, which follows the player, and the skull, which charges forward when it sees the player. The player is equipped with a magic wand that they can use to banish enemies from the maze. When an enemy is banished, a sound effect and particle system plays. Once 25 enemies are banished, the player escapes and is taken to the end screen. If the player collides with an enemy, a sound effect plays, and on the 5th collision, the player dies and they're taken to a death screen. All scenes (Start Menu, Tutorial Menu, Maze, End Menu, and Death Menu) have unique music.
